# Terraform and Ansible Infrastructure Project

This repository combines **Terraform** and **Ansible** to provision and configure cloud infrastructure. Terraform handles the infrastructure provisioning, while Ansible is used for post-provisioning configuration and software deployment.

---

## Features

- **Terraform for Infrastructure Provisioning**: Automates the creation of AWS infrastructure such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more.
- **Ansible for Configuration Management**: Configures provisioned instances, deploys Nginx, and sets up a web server.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Ensures consistent and reusable configurations.
- **Secure Configuration**: Sensitive data, such as private keys, is excluded from the repository using `.gitignore`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed:

- **Terraform**: [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- **Ansible**: [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- **AWS CLI**: [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kush-shah05/kaib.git
cd kaib
```

---

### Step 2: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

1. **Navigate to the Terraform Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the Deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Note the Outputs**:
   Terraform will output necessary information (e.g., IP addresses) for use in Ansible.

---

### Step 3: Configure Instances with Ansible

1. **Update Ansible Inventory**:
   Update `ansible/inventories/<env>` with the IP addresses of the provisioned instances.

2. **Run Ansible Playbook**:
   Execute the Ansible playbook to configure the instances:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/dev ansible/playbooks/install_nginx.yml
   ```

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Private Keys**: Ensure private keys are excluded using `.gitignore`.
- **State Files**: Avoid committing Terraform state files (`terraform.tfstate`) as they may contain sensitive information.
- **Ansible Vault**: Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive variables.
